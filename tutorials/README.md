# Tutorials

In this folder you can find a collection of useful Notebooks containing several tutorials, in order to understand the principles and the potential of **PyDMD**. An additional PDF tutorial ([DSWeb contest winner](https://dsweb.siam.org/The-Magazine/All-Issues/dsweb-2019-contest-tutorials-on-dynamical-systems-software)) is available [here](tutorial_dsweb.pdf).

We plan to add more tutorials but the time is often against us. If you want to contribute with a notebook on a feature not covered yet we will be very happy and give you support on editing!
