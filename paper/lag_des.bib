Throughout the paper ”side-by-side” comparisons of the performance of Lagrangian descriptors with both ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) and ﬁnite time averages of certain components of the vector ﬁeld (”time averages”) are carried out and discussed. In all cases Lagrangian descriptors are shown to be both more accurate and computationally eﬃcient than these methods. We also perform computations for an explicitly three dimensional, aperiodically time-dependent vector ﬁeld and an aperiodically time dependent vector ﬁeld deﬁned as a data set.

In particular, because of the climate impact of ocean transport processes, we illustrate an application on altimeter data sets over the area of the Kuroshio Current. First, a global Lagrangian descriptor recently described in [1] is used on the dataset. Over the ocean surface a phase portrait is represented where the geometry of interconnected dynamical systems is visible. The organising centres of the ﬂow are located at a glance: hyperbolic points -related to highly dispersive regions- and non-hyperbolic areas that are related to conﬁnement regions. The phase portrait picture is very helpful to foresee which transport routes can be deduced from the stable and unstable manifolds of the easily identiﬁed distinguished hyperbolic trajectories (see [2]) of the ﬂow.},

Throughout the paper ”side-by-side” comparisons of the performance of Lagrangian descriptors with both ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) and ﬁnite time averages of certain components of the vector ﬁeld (”time averages”) are carried out and discussed. In all cases Lagrangian descriptors are shown to be both more accurate and computationally eﬃcient than these methods. We also perform computations for an explicitly three dimensional, aperiodically time-dependent vector ﬁeld and an aperiodically time dependent vector ﬁeld deﬁned as a data set. Comparisons with FTLEs and time averages for these examples are also carried out, with similar conclusions as for the benchmark examples.},

The set-up is a 2D domain with periodic boundary conditions along the horizontal coordinate. At a ﬁxed aspect ratio, the analysis is assisted by bifurcation techniques such as branch continuation, which has proven to be a useful, systematic method for gaining insight into the possible stationary solutions satisﬁed by the basic equations. Stable stationary solutions become unstable through a Hopf bifurcation, after which the time-dependent regime is solved by the spectral techniques proposed for that purpose in this article. The morphology of the plume is described and compared with others obtained in the literature.},

In particular, because of the climate impact of ocean transport processes, we illustrate a 2D application on altimeter data sets over the area of the Kuroshio Current, although the proposed techniques are general and applicable to arbitrary time dependent aperiodic ﬂows. The ﬁrst challenge for describing transport in aperiodical time dependent ﬂows is obtaining a representation of the phase portrait where the most relevant dynamical features may be identiﬁed. This representation is accomplished by using global Lagrangian descriptors that when applied for instance to the altimeter data sets retrieve over the ocean surface a phase portrait where the geometry of interconnected dynamical systems is visible. The phase portrait picture is essential because it evinces which transport routes are acting on the whole ﬂow. Once these routes are roughly recognised it is possible to complete a detailed description by the direct computation of the ﬁnite time stable and unstable manifolds of special hyperbolic trajectories that act as organising centres of the ﬂow.},

First we develop a benchmark method in which all the trajectories composing the manifold are integrated from the neighborhood of the hyperbolic trajectory. This choice, although very accurate, is not fast and has limited usage. A faster and more powerful algorithm requires the insertion of new points in the manifold as it evolves in time. Its numerical implementation requires a criterion for determining when to insert those points in the manifold, and an interpolation method for determining where to insert them. We compare four different point insertion criteria and four different interpolation methods. We discuss the computational requirements of all of these methods. We ﬁnd two of the four point insertion criteria to be accurate and robust. One is a variant of a criterion originally proposed by Hobson. The other is a slight variant of a method due to Dritschel and Ambaum arising from their studies of contour dynamics. The preferred interpolation method is also due to Dritschel. These methods are then applied to the computation of the stable and unstable manifolds of the hyperbolic trajectories of several aperiodically time-dependent variants of the Dufﬁng equation.},

The goal of achieving rigourous proofs that justify the ability of LDs to detect invariant manifolds is simpliﬁed by introducing an alternative deﬁnition for LDs. The deﬁnition is stated for n-dimensional systems with general time dependence, however we rigorously prove that this method reveals the stable and unstable manifolds of hyperbolic points in four particular 2D cases: a hyperbolic saddle point for linear autonomous systems, a hyperbolic saddle point for nonlinear autonomous systems, a hyperbolic saddle point for linear nonautonomous systems and a hyperbolic saddle point for nonlinear nonautonomous systems. We also discuss further rigorous results which show the ability of LDs to highlight additional invariants sets, such as n-tori. These results are just a simple extension of the ergodic partition theory which we illustrate by applying this methodology to well-known examples, such as the planar ﬁeld of the harmonic oscillator and the 3D ABC ﬂow. Finally, we provide a thorough discussion on the requirement of the objectivity (frameinvariance) property for tools designed to reveal phase space structures and their implications for Lagrangian descriptors.},

The existence of these manifolds has been proven rigorously, and explicit algorithms are available for their calculation. We now show that these extended structures can be used to obtain reaction rates directly in dissipative systems. We also suggest a treatment for the substantially more general case in which the molecular solvent is fully speciﬁed by the positions of all its atoms.

In particular, because of the climate impact of ocean transport processes, we illustrate a 2D application on altimeter data sets over the area of the Kuroshio Current, although the proposed techniques are general and applicable to arbitrary time dependent aperiodic ﬂows. The ﬁrst challenge for describing transport in aperiodical time dependent ﬂows is obtaining a representation of the phase portrait where the most relevant dynamical features may be identiﬁed. This representation is accomplished by using global Lagrangian descriptors that when applied for instance to the altimeter data sets retrieve over the ocean surface a phase portrait where the geometry of interconnected dynamical systems is visible. The phase portrait picture is essential because it evinces which transport routes are acting on the whole ﬂow. Once these routes are roughly recognised it is possible to complete a detailed description by the direct computation of the ﬁnite time stable and unstable manifolds of special hyperbolic trajectories that act as organising centres of the ﬂow.},

First we develop a benchmark method in which all the trajectories composing the manifold are integrated from the neighborhood of the hyperbolic trajectory. This choice, although very accurate, is not fast and has limited usage. A faster and more powerful algorithm requires the insertion of new points in the manifold as it evolves in time. Its numerical implementation requires a criterion for determining when to insert those points in the manifold, and an interpolation method for determining where to insert them. We compare four different point insertion criteria and four different interpolation methods. We discuss the computational requirements of all of these methods. We ﬁnd two of the four point insertion criteria to be accurate and robust. One is a variant of a criterion originally proposed by Hobson. The other is a slight variant of a method due to Dritschel and Ambaum arising from their studies of contour dynamics. The preferred interpolation method is also due to Dritschel. These methods are then applied to the computation of the stable and unstable manifolds of the hyperbolic trajectories of several aperiodically time-dependent variants of the Dufﬁng equation.},

Recent advances in dynamical systems theory have helped to identify the interconnected manifolds—‘‘superhighways”—leading from reactants to products. The existence of these manifolds has been proven rigorously, and explicit algorithms are available for their calculation. We now show that these extended structures can be used to obtain reaction rates directly in dissipative systems. We also suggest a treatment for the substantially more general case in which the molecular solvent is fully speciﬁed by the positions of all its atoms. Speciﬁcally, we can construct effective solvent conﬁgurations for which the exact TST manifolds can be constructed and used to sample the rates of an open system.},

In this work we bring out this connection in terms of phase space structures known as reactive islands and thereby provide the anatomy of a rare event. En route, we obtain insights into the transition path sampling method for harvesting rare trajectories from a phase space perspective. We show that quantum dynamics is sensitive to the reactive islands, thereby answering a question raised by De Leon and Berne.

	abstract = {Dynamics between reactants and products are often mediated by a rate-determining barrier and an associated dividing surface leading to the transition state theory rate. This framework is challenged when the barrier is time-dependent because its motion can give rise to recrossings across the ﬁxed dividing surface. A non-recrossing time-dependent dividing surface can nevertheless be attached to the TS trajectory resulting in recrossing-free dynamics. We extend the formalism—constructed using Lagrangian Descriptors—to systems with additional bath degrees of freedom. The propagation of reactant ensembles provides a numerical demonstration that our dividing surface is recrossing-free and leads to exact TST rates.},

Our data correspond to the months from June through August 2010. Structures obtained from HYCOM are noisier than those from AVISO; however, both AVISO and HYCOM succeed in identifying Lagrangian structures that inﬂuence the paths of drifters, such as eddies, currents, lobes, etc. We ﬁnd evidence in which AVISO gives the positions of important hyperbolic trajectories in a manner that is inconsistent with the trajectories of the drifters, while for the same examples HYCOM succeeds to this end.},
