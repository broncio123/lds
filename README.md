Repository hosting work in progress towards the construction of a Python package for Computation of Lagrangian Descriptors for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems.


# Install minimal package dependencies before running Notebooks


First, make sure to use `pip` within the `conda` environment.

So, do as shown below.


```bash
# FIRST
conda install pip
# SECOND
pip install -r requeriments.txt
```


# CHANGE LOG

* Incorporated suggested changes for code transparency (Thanks v!) 
* Added `requirements.txt`


# TO-DOs

* Add `docstrings` for description of define functions
* Add further comments to functions
* Port functions defined within notebook to script libraries
* Once done, as use examples


## NEXT STAGES
* Break down functions to achieve a more modular structure
* Maybe define classes of objects
