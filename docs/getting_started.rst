Getting started
===============

The purpose of this guide is to illustrate the computation and visualization of Lagrangian descriptors of dynamical systems. 

To use this package, the prerequisite is a basic understanding of nonlinear dynamical systems concepts mentioned in the glossary.

Then, a brief introduction to the method of Lagrangian descriptor can be found in the Tutorial section.

Then, consider running the examples starting with the ones described in the Examples section.
