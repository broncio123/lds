Glossary of Common Terms and API Elements
=========================================

This glossary hopes to definitively represent the tacit and explicit
conventions applied in Scikit-learn and its API, while providing a reference
for users and contributors. It aims to describe the concepts and either detail
their corresponding API or link to other relevant parts of the documentation
which do so. By linking to glossary entries from the API Reference and User
Guide, we may minimize redundancy and inconsistency.

We begin by listing general concepts (and any that didn't fit elsewhere), but
more specific sets of related terms are listed below:
