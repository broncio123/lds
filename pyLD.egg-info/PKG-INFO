        Summary
        -------
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        # Install minimal package dependencies before running Notebooks
        
        First, make sure to use `pip` within the `conda` environment using
        
        ```bash
        # FIRST
        conda install pip
        # SECOND
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        Clone the git repository and install `ldds` as a module using
        
        ``` bash
        $ git clone git@github.com:champsproject/ldds.git
        $ cd ldds
        $ python setup.py install
        ```
        
        The `setup.py` should also install the modules listed in
        [requirements.txt](https://github.com/champsproject/ldds/blob/develop/requirements.txt)
        and which are typically installed using
        
        ``` bash
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt (or pip3 install -r requirements.txt)
        ```
        
        Now `ldds` module is available for import along with the methods and
        example systems as submodules, for example (SHOW HOW TO IMPORT HERE)
        
        ``` python
        
        
        ```
